# Heart Disease Classification – ML Deployment Project

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build, evaluate, and deploy multiple machine
learning classification models to predict the presence of heart disease using
patient medical attributes.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used is the UCI Heart Disease dataset. It contains more than 900
patient records with 13 medical attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood
pressure, and chest pain type. The target variable indicates the presence or
absence of heart disease.
